Catch-all location for learning new things. <br>

I got tired of making new projects every time I wanted to learn a new
programming language or framework, so I decided to make a monorepo
instead. <br>

**Please note!!** Nothing in here is garunteed to be in any sort of working 
order. By definition, the entire thing is very much a work in progress.

### What's in the box?  
... an awful lot of stuff. <br>

As of time of writing, I've used this repo as a space for learning about:
- [Dart](https://dart.dev), Google's client-geared language for building cross-
platforms applications using
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), a cross-platform app framework
- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), a memory-safe systems-level programming 
language optimized for Annoying People (that's me, hi, I am Annoying People)
- Maybe some throwaway python scripts if I ever get them in here?

### Project Breakdown
Highly unlikely anyone but me will ever see anything in this repo, but just in 
case, it's worth noting there is indeed a method to my madness here. <br>
- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions, sorted first by year and then by language
    - 2022:
        - Dart (10/25)
        - Rust (1/25)
    - 2023: 
        - Rust (1/25)
- Asteroids, a web-oriented rework of the classic arcade game with some personal
touches (for both fun and copyright infringement avoidance!). This is a smaller
effort within the larger scope of reworking my personal website, [nicolena.net](nicolena.net).
    - Dart
    - Flame, a game engine for Flutter
    - Flutter
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) solutions sorted first by language and then by problem
    - Rust (x/n)
- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) solutions
    - Rust (x/n)
- Flutter Tutorials, my Flutter mega-app for getting more familiar with the 
framework and experimenting with self-contained concepts. Mostly just following
along with the YouTube tutorials though.
    - Dart
    - Flutter
- Nicolena Dot Net, the current WIP version of my personal website, [nicolena.net](). 
Once this is in better working order, I'll be moving it into its own repo. 
    - Dart
    - Flame
    - Flutter
    - Maybe some backend Rust/SQL?
