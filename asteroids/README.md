# asteroids

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


### Dev Notes
`player.dart`
1. Would like to use [particles](https://docs.flame-engine.org/latest/flame/rendering/particles.html)
for explosions with the ship.
2. Would like to add the pulsing or visual indicator glow effect from [the
effects library](https://docs.flame-engine.org/latest/flame/effects.html) but
the effect itself isn't very mature yet.
